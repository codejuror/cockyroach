This is a flappy-birdish inspired game for a game company's technical exam.

This was part of my 2-week technical exam in a gaming company along with a bunch of theoretical and practical tests.

After passing and being subjected for an interview, I just learned that they won't be able to proceed anyway due to visa restrictions even though I mentioned it from the start of my application process.

Out of a bit of frustration, I chose this as my first-ever personal repo (YES, even if I have been a programmer for more than a decade).

Please note that this is my first time trying out game developement and SDL, plus the fact that this has been rushed because, well, exam, but I am planning to improve its code structure (and maybe the game itself) if my interest kicks in.

Cheers, codejuror
